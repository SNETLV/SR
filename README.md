# Configuration rules for Shadowrocket client

Currently, 2 types of .conf configurations are updated according to the following logic:

### 1. Direct
All domains are connected directly to the Internet provider, except for "departed" companies and some others.

### 2. Proxy
All domains are connected via a proxy server except for local ones.

The lists of rules are included in the configurations as a RULE-SET with links to .list files.
